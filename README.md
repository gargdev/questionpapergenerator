Certainly! Below is an example of a README file that you can include in your project. This assumes you have separate directories for the backend and frontend, and the backend script is named `generatePaper.js`:

```markdown
# Question Paper Generator

This project is a Question Paper Generator with separate components for the backend and frontend. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the application.

## Backend Setup

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `backend` directory:

```bash
cd backend
```

2. Install the dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

3. After installing the dependencies, run the following command to start the backend server:

```bash
node generatePaper.js
```

The backend server will now be running.

## Frontend Setup

1. Open a new terminal window (while keeping the backend terminal open) and navigate to the `frontend` directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install the frontend dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

3. After installing the dependencies, run the following command to start the frontend application:

```bash
npm start
```

The frontend application will now be accessible in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser to use the Question Paper Generator. The frontend communicates with the backend, which generates question papers based on the provided inputs.

Feel free to explore and customize the code to meet your specific requirements.
